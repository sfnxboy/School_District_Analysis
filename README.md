# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
In this project we are tasked with preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presenting insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights may be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. Our objective is to look for relationships between student funding, and student standardized test scores. Our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in the districts performance. 

The PyCitySchools.ipynb file contains Python code that fulfills all of the tasks determined below. Due to evidence of academic dishonesty in Thomas High School's ninth grade class, their reading and math exam scores will be rendered void. A second file, PyCitySchools_(Thomas_High_School).ipynb accounts for this. We will refer to this second file for the README.md file.

### Tasks

-	A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format

-	An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format

-	Tables presenting each of the following metrics:

•	Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate

•	The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school

•	The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school

•	School performance based on the budget per student

•	School performance based on the school size 

•	School performance based on the type of school


### Pandas
Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. Commonly used with Jupyter Notebook, Pandas offers great functionality including reading raw data, cleaning and inspecting the data, merging data sets, performing calculations, and creating tables. All of these tasks are part of the data wrangling, or data “munging” process that data analysists do to clean, sort, and transform data into a format that can be more easily analyzed and used to convey information. The data wrangling process may include changing the data layout and structure, organizing the data by type, formatting rows or columns, and sorting or grouping data. Pandas is very flexible, optimized for performance, and exceeds Excel in terms of functionality.
