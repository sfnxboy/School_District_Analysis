# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
In this project we are tasked with preparing all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presenting insights about performance trends and patterns. These insights may be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. Our objective is to look for relationships between student funding, and student standardized test scores. Our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance

### Pandas
Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. Commonly used with Jupyter Notebook, Pandas offers great functionality including reading raw data, cleaning and inspecting the data, merging data sets, performing calculations, and creating tables. All of these tasks are part of the data wrangling, or data “munging” process that data analysists do to clean, sort, and transform data into a format that can be more easily analyzed and used to convey information. The data wrangling process may include changing the data layout and structure, organizing the data by type, formatting rows or columns, and sorting or grouping data. Pandas is very flexible, optimized for performance, and exceeds Excel in terms of functionality.
